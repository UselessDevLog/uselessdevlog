We are two enthusiast of gaming industry, gamers before developers. Our goal is not showing our skills (or lack of them) but creating a database of what we know in order to improve our knowledge by time to time. Our interest does not focus on a specific field: of course in something one of us is better than the other and viceversa, but we have an eclectic curiosity in game development. 



Discussion with occasional users is highly encouraged since we are just students, not masters, and our first concern is to learn, not to teach. Tutorials are results of indipendent study, scripts are outcome of many, many attempts and days of work. Neither of us is a professionist (for now) therefore what will be posted here is by no means intended to be a absolute solution to game development questions. Think this blog as a collection of hints, a source of ispiration. 




We are at the beginning of a long path so not much materials will be posted for now, but, over time, more and more of our work will be uploaded. 



Maybe one day this blog will become something more than this (or be closed), for now we just keep doing what we love.
