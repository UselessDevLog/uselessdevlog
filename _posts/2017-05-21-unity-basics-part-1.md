> **Note**: This is the first part of a small series, or as I love to call it, a *Rubrica*, which was written in 2017 with unity 5.4 - 5.6. So, if you are a reader from the future, maybe it will result to be outdated.



# First Steps In Unity

Unity is a Game Engine developed by Unity Technologies which is primarly used to make videogame. You can download it by click on this link and follow the steps described there:

[Download Unity](https://store.unity.com/?).

Before start teaching some code, it is usefull to know some *keywords* and aspects of this engine. First, in Unity you can write code in different programming languages:

- **Boo**: pls don't...
- **Javascript (sort of)**: this is not properly javascript, it's <u>UnityScript</u>. In Unity's previous versions, it was very popular and today there are some tutorials written in UnityScripts, somewhere. But it is becoming less and less used in favor of a more solid and performing language like c#.
- **C#**: Is the most used programming language by Unity's community. It's more advanced and optimized, than either Boo and Javascript and interacts better with Obj C and XCode. It's becoming the standard language for gaming on multiple platforms. C# does have some disvantages but will cover this in anoter posts in future. 

In this Rubrica, I'll write code in c#, starting from the very basics.

### Tabs and Windows

There are multiple tabs in Unity, usually I prefer a layout that gives more visibility to Scene and Game, just like this:

![unityframe]({{site.url}}/images/unityframe.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Click `Layout` on top right corner:

 `Layout -> 2 by 3 Column` 

and then:

<p style="text-align: center">

`Right Click on Project -> one column layout`

</p>

#### Scene

#### Game

#### Hierarchy 

#### Project

#### Inspector

### Coordinates
