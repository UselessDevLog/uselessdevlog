> **Note**: This is the first part of a small series, or as I love to call it, a *Rubrica*, which was written in 2017 with unity 5.4 - 5.6. So, if you are a reader from the future, maybe it will result to be outdated.



# First Steps In Unity

Unity is a Game Engine developed by Unity Technologies which is primarly used to make videogame. You can download it by click on this link and follow the steps described there:

[Download Unity](https://store.unity.com/?).

Before start teaching some code, it is usefull to know some *keywords* and aspects of this engine. First, in Unity you can write code in different programming languages:

- **Boo**: pls don't...
- **Javascript (sort of)**: this is not properly javascript, it's <u>UnityScript</u>. In Unity's previous versions, it was very popular and today there are some tutorials written in UnityScripts, somewhere. But it is becoming less and less used in favor of a more solid and performing language like c#.
- **C#**: Is the most used programming language by Unity's community. It's more advanced and optimized, than either Boo and Javascript and interacts better with Obj C and XCode. It's becoming the standard language for gaming on multiple platforms. C# does have some disvantages but will cover this in anoter posts in future. 

In this Rubrica, I'll write code in c#, starting from the very basics.

### Tabs and Windows

There are multiple tabs in Unity, usually I prefer a layout that gives more visibility to Scene and Game, just like this:

![unityframe]({{site.url}}/images/unityframe.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Click `Layout` on top right corner:

 `Layout -> 2 by 3 Column` 

and then:

`Right Click on Project -> one column layout`

#### Scene

The <u>Scene</u> Windows where you will construct your 3D or 2D scene by manipulating, dragging and dropping GameObjects.

You can navigate or modify GameObject in your Scene using top Top Left buttons or with these shortcut: Navigate <kdb>Q</kdb>, Move <kdb>W</kdb>, Rotate <kdb>E</kdb> and Scale <kdb>R</kdb>. There are another shortcuts really useful when compose a scene:

- Navigation

  | ![Left Click]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/leftClick.png) | Move Left and Right based on point. |
  | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | ![Right Click]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/rightClick.png) | Rotate around point you are on.     |
  | ![Alt Key]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/alt.png) +  ![Left Click]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/leftClick.png) | Rotate around a selected point.     |
  | ![Alt Key]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/alt.png) + ![Right Click]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/rightClick.png) | Zoom on a point you are watching.   |
  | ![F Key]({{site.url}}/images/keycode/fkey.png) | Focus on selected object.           |



#### Game



#### Hierarchy 

#### Project

#### Inspector

### Coordinates
